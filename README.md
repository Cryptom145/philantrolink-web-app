# Philantrolink Web App (for Admins)

This project utilizes React and Firebase to create Philantrolink's web application.

## Getting Started

Run **npm install** on your device using the terminal (for VSCode users) after cloning the code to install the necessary node modules.

Run **npm run dev** to run the application locally.

To log in, use the sample user:

    Username: test@test.com
    Password: test123

OR, you can make an account yourself; just be warned that the Facebook login is still not functional.
